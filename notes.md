Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or "building-blocks": ketoacyl and isoprene groups, based on this approach they are divided into the following groups

- fatty acids
- glycerolipids
- glycerophospholipids
- sphingolipids
- saccharolipids
- polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits)
- sterol lipids
- prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits)
